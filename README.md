What might be betrayal   but a turn in thought
By a mind too quickly,   freely fleeting? Naught
condemneth it, nor holds   its reasn’ning in contempt
except that it so willing   its own fantasy hath dreampt.

What, then, is temptation?   Is it man led astray?
Might it be the op’ning of   his eyes to the new day?
And as the mighty lion’s   graceful tread at dawn is lost
so forsaketh man his highest   morals--a small cost

to venture to those starry   heights on steps of reason
and glimpse how seems the holy hell.   The paradisiac heathen
sees but once his holy God   and yet reveres the mem’ry.
Is he but a heathen still,   or heathen now most heav’nly?

And can, then, love sinful be?   Desire, then, a crime?
Shall we heed forgotten laws   from unforgotten times?
What God can forbid us   so essential a thing?
Methinks that God would man   in his good time blaspheme.

I pray thou think’st me not   a lowly sinner thus
in his guilt denied God,   for thou condemnest us;
both are we damned so   and still perfectly pure
if thou but know’st no heav’n,   no hell, no sin, no fear!

Then what shouldst thou find   they, cast away, did leave?
Not, I pray, a clinging will   allows thee still to grieve!
For what forlorn thing mournst thou   that I have yet forgotten?
See how lies now in its place   raw desire, fast begotten--

The guilt, the bite! the wretched   blessing of knowledge free
that scars and burns and rends   his flesh whose knowledge he
in willful ignorance   cannot but hope to tame
and mirthfully leaves him   to be kiss’d by the flame.

For that is but the blaze   of desire whose greed doth match
the great, voracious fire   from whose embers shall hatch,
in time, the beastly thing   called human reason thou
wantest so, and prayest   that one thee should bestow.
